This assignment was challenging.
I spent well over 20 hours jumping around and adding/deleting things to get any functionality.
I wanted to kind of customize this a little and play around with colors and funtionality of the site in general.

This portfolio will be updated as time goes on and I get more content and more photos relating to me.
I will continually update information and skillsets.
Maybe add another page for references and make the footer have social media links.

I had a lot of fun!

Need some help with certain things in some of the notes.
WHen the portfolio page goes in tiny, some of the images end up being slightly diferent sizes.
The index page I have the paragraph text fall under the photo, but during the process of it shrinking down, the photo immediately becomes small and leaves a lot of white space.

Footer wasnt from bootstrap. I made it and just added a large margin on each CSS file to get it to where I wanted it. Is there a better way? I had containers, rows to attempt to make it work and the footer sat right under the content in the middle of the page.

I have screenshots of each page in the images folder.

I also had a question reagrding the CSS files for each page.
Should I make multiple CSS files for each page or is there a way to have it all on 1?
